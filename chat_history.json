This includes a lack of clear explanations about procedures, tests, and care plans. Some patients felt their concerns were dismissed or not taken seriously.\n*   **Customer Quotes:**\n    *   \"There just wasn't great communication. I felt like between the nurses and between me, I just felt like they weren't talking through anything as I didn't really know what was happening and I felt really confused...\" (Review 1)\n    *   \"Some confusion about what tests were or were not being ordered and why/when.\" (Review 9)\n    *   \"I feel as if my questions and concerns were passed off as silly and unimportant.

This is the reason I only gave a 9 on recommending this facility to family and friends.\" (Review 5)\n    *   \"Food could be improved in quality and portion size. Healthier options low in sugar would have been appreciated.\" (Review 6)\n    *   \"The only problem there was, was the food. The ladies on the phone sounded like they had attitudes and you didn't know what all you could get. One day I only received one piece of bread made into French toast and one slice of a bacon. And i was not on a special diet. They didn't try to explain what all you could get from the menu.\" (Review 10)\n*   **Emotions:** Dissatisfaction, disappointment.\n*   **Frequency:** Frequent comment.\n*   **Impact Level:** Medium\n\n### Lack of Attention to Patient Needs and Concerns\n*   **Description:** Some patients felt their specific needs and concerns were not adequately addressed.

One day in the hospital was not enough time for recovery and rest. Since pain meds could not be prescribed after being discharged it made me feel as if being in pain was not a concern to the doctors.\" (Review 15)\n    *   \"For me they did not give me a solution to my problem, they did not check me. Where I had pain they only told me to buy the medicine and the doctor who treated me was very angry and I will not return to that place\" (Review 12)\n*   **Emotions:** Frustration, feeling ignored, feeling uncared for.\n*   **Frequency:** Mentioned in several reviews.\n*   **Impact Level:** High\n\n### Other Issues\n*   **Description:** This category includes less frequent but still significant issues such as cleanliness, parking fees, and deviations from birth plans.\n*   **Customer Quotes:**\n    *   \"Only complaint was that the shower in the mother baby room was not clean. Also, it seems unfair for families have to pay for parking.\" (Review 4)\n    *   \"The only issue I had was that my birth plan wasn't fully followed but for the most part it was. It may also be because there was a change of shift right around the time I gave birth. Overall I am satisfied\" (Review 8)\n*   **Emotions:** Annoyance, dissatisfaction.\n*   **Frequency:** One instance each.\n*   **Impact Level:** Low to Medium\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nCustomer dissatisfaction primarily stems from communication breakdowns, inadequate attention to patient needs and concerns (especially regarding pain management and breastfeeding support), and issues with food quality and options.

There just wasn't great communication. I felt like between the nurses and between me, I just felt like they weren't talking through anything as I didn't really know what was happening and I felt really confused and I didn't really like even getting my epidural, they had to try like 4 times when they could've just moved me on the bed and so it was really difficult to get me numbed up and so that was really frustrating 'cause I was having really intense contractions during it. So that would be my feedback is just better communication and just even if people*\" - This review is representative because it encapsulates the core issues of poor communication, feeling unheard, and a negative experience during a vulnerable time (childbirth).\n*   **Review 5:** \"I would suggest offering better food options especially for mother's that just gave birth. This is the reason I only gave a 9 on recommending this facility to family and friends.\" - This review is representative because it highlights the dissatisfaction with food options, a recurring theme in the feedback, and directly links it to the likelihood of recommending the facility.\n*   **Review 14:** \"The lactation consultant Janet did not take my concerns about my son's latch or tongue tie seriously. I knew he had a tie - which had to be corrected at an ENT the following Friday - and now he's struggling with breastfeeding. I'm very frustrated that this concern wasn't taken seriously because it's caused huge problems in our EBF journey and now we have to supplement formula, and Judah lost a significant portion of weight because he could not latch correctly.\" - This review is representative because it highlights the lack of attention to patient needs and concerns, specifically regarding breastfeeding support, and the negative consequences that resulted from this lack of attention.\n\n## Emotion Breakdown\n\nWhile the emotion labels are \"Unknown\" for all reviews, we can infer the following emotions based on the text:\n\n*   **Frustration:** Evident in reviews discussing communication issues, difficulty with procedures, unmet requests, and ignored concerns.\n*   **Confusion:** Arises from a lack of clear communication and explanations.\n*   **Dissatisfaction:** Expressed regarding food quality, cleanliness, and overall experience.\n*   **Feeling Unimportant/Uncared For:** Stems from concerns being dismissed or not taken seriously.\n*   **Annoyance:** Associated with issues like parking fees.",

His performance and the silver slugger award were highlighted.\n    * \"All of my favorite players hit homers (Kyle Manzardo, Jose Ramirez, and angel martinez)\" (Review 5, Love)\n    * \"Dennis Martinez and Kenny Lofton warming up before the game and Jose Ramirez earning his silver slugger award\" (Review 7, No Emotion)\n    * \"Perry’s ice cream, Barrio, and RamÃ­rez/Manzardoâ€™s home runs\" (Review 10, No Emotion)\n    * \"The better experience in my life , I wish met a Ramirez player , I love\" (Review 11, Love)\n    * \"Food, shirt, games, the game, Jose Ramirez\" (Review 13, No Emotion)\n    * \"Watching Jose homer after getting walked twice.\" (Review 23, No Emotion)\n    * \"Because of Jose Ramirez and Steven kwan\" (Review 20, No Emotion)\n\n* The frequency of mentions is high, indicating a significant positive impact on customer experience.\n* The overall emotion associated with these mentions is overwhelmingly positive (love and enjoyment).\n* Impact Level: High\n\n\n## Feedback on Player Information and Game Stats\n\nSeveral reviews expressed a desire for more detailed information about players and game statistics displayed on the scoreboard.\n\n* \"It would be nice if the score board showed how many current outs and the speed of each pitch. It would also be nice to share some personal facts or baseball records of each player.\" (Review 1, No Emotion)\n* \"Additional stats should be added to the player information (throughout the game not just the first at bat). Not all demographics follow those stats and other appreciated player stats could include things like player bat information (style, wood type, etc.), player height/weight, hometown, length of time with the team, and walk out song name.\" (Review 4, No Emotion)\n* \"Would love to see more fun facts about the players up on the screen\" (Review 6, Enjoy)\n* \"I really like when they show things about the players. Example: Rouglas Odor (third base coach) uncle of Rougned Odor (Yankees player)\" (Review 9, Enjoy)\n\nThis feedback is frequent and suggests a medium impact on the overall game experience.

Another review expressed disappointment that no players came out to sign autographs.\n\n* \"It would be amazing if there was more opportunity to get autographs either before or after the game, especially for kids.

Impact Level: Medium\n\n\n## Executive Summary of Game Feedback\n\nOverall, customer feedback regarding the game experience was largely positive.  The performance of specific players, particularly Bo Naylor and José Ramírez, significantly contributed to positive sentiment.  However, there is room for improvement in providing more detailed player information and statistics on the scoreboard and creating more opportunities for fan interaction, such as autograph sessions.\n\n\n## Representative Game Experience Comments\n\n* \"This is me and my sister first Guardians game and we are having a wonderful time.\" (Review 3, Love) - This quote represents the positive overall experience many attendees had.\n* \"The Cleveland Guardians’ game...was a thrilling showcase of resilience and team effort...\" (Review 18, Thrilling) - This quote exemplifies the excitement and engagement many felt during the game itself.\n* \"Not one player came out to sign autographs for the kids?
